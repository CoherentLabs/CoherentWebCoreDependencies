NASM (http://www.nasm.us/) is required to build parts of OpenSSL.

Until NASM's Windows installer provides a property sheet and build
rules for VS2010 (it already does so for VS2008), we need to manually
teach VS2010 about NASM.

These settings were created by 'perilbrain' on the Code Project site
in a very informative article:

http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/410776/Integrating-a-compiler-assembler-in-VS-Using-NASM

The property sheets and XML files are licensed under the "Code Project
Open License (CPOL) 1.02" (see http://www.codeproject.com/info/cpol10.aspx
or the file CPOL.html).

INSTALLATION
1. Install NASM.
2. Add the NASM installation path to the PATH variable.
3. Copy nasm.prop, nasm.targets, and nasm.xml to "C:\Program Files\MSBuild\Microsoft.Cpp\v4.0\BuildCustomizations\",
   alongside the existing masm versions.
